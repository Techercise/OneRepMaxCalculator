# OneRepMaxCalculator
A tool to easily calculate a projected one rep max (ORM) for lifting. This app gives a more accurate estimation of the user's one rep max of a lift by taking the seven ORM formulas and finding the average of them. The average ensures there is no over-estimation, nor underestimation.

Unfortunately, the original source files were deleted so I've had trouble committing future versions to git. The latest version currently exists on the Google Play Store.
